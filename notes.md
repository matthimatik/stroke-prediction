Data-Driven Machine Learning: Ensuring Quality in Model Development

Project Overview:

This project provides practical experience in machine learning, covering aspects from **data quality** and **preprocessing** to **model development** and **deployment**. Students will choose one of the following tasks, each involving a different data type. The tasks are designed to highlight the **importance of data quality in AI** and also to engage students in the entire process of machine learning model development, including software engineering best practices and deployment on a modern platform like **Hugging Face**.

1. Tabular Data:

- Objective: Create a model for predictive analytics using tabular data.
- Key Considerations:
        Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data. If the data is already clean, introduce simulated data errors.
        Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones for better model performance.
        Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for tabular data.
        SE Best Practices: Implement unit testing, logging, and thorough documentation for maintainability and code quality.
        Dataset: Kaggle's Stroke Prediction dataset

General Instructions for All Options:

    Model Development: Develop and evaluate the model, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability while respecting SE best practices.
    Deployment: Deploy the model on the Hugging Face platform and showcase its application.
    Data Quality Report: Include a detailed analysis of data quality, challenges faced, and measures taken to ensure data integrity.
    Report and Presentation: Include workflow pipeline, model development, data quality analysis, SE best practices, and key findings.
    You can use the dataset of your choice.

Final Deliverables:

    Well-Documented Code Repository
